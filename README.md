# ner-not-pipeline
NER and Network-of-Terms pipeline

Basic experiment for creating an NER and keyword extraction pipeline in combination with querying the [NDE Netwerk of Terms](https://github.com/netwerk-digitaal-erfgoed/network-of-terms). The code inspired by the Hands-On 1.2 code from the [Open HPI Knowledge Graph Course 2023](https://open.hpi.de/courses/knowledgegraphs2023).

It is recommended to use a virtual environment, create one using the following command:
```sh
$ python -m venv ./venv
```
Then activate the virtual evironment using:
```sh
$ source venv/bin/activate
```
This will result in a prompt starting with `(venv)`, the virtual environment is now activated.

Now install the requirend packages:
```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will result in list of packages that are being installed and it should end with no errors.

We are using the Spacy module for doing the Named Entity Recognition (NER). And because we are analyzing Dutch texts we need to download a Dutch model, in this case the `nl_core_news_lg` model:
```
$ python -m spacy download nl_core_news_lg
```
It will take a short while to download the almost 600MB sized model.

Start the program with:
```sh
$ python ner-not.py haarlem.txt
```

Use different text files to try out different results for the pipeline.

The pipeline uses the Spacy Tokenization and NER functionality to extract keywords and named entities. The identified nouns and named entities are fed to the Network of Terms (NoT) to find matching terms. The reconcilation with the Network of Terms is configured for the different NER types. The `config.json` file connects the NER type to the relevant source to query for the Network of Terms. The nouns are matched against the list of sources specified under "CONCEPT". 

Bases on the configuration all the NoT sources are queried. The results are processed in the order defined in the config file. As soon as one of the found pref- or altLabels has an exact match with the named entity the URI of this term is returned and the processing of the result stops.

The result is written as semicolon delimited CSV file with basename of the input file. The outfile contains the complete term information as found in the Network of Terms results. 

A slightly modified version of the code was created as a Google Colab Notebook with the name 'ner-not-pipeline.ipynb'. From Google Colab this file can be directly imported from Github.
